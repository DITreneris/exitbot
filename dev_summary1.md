# ExitBot Development Summary

## Project Overview
ExitBot is an AI-powered exit interview assistant that automates the process of conducting exit interviews using large language models (LLMs). The system provides a natural conversational experience for departing employees while collecting valuable feedback for the organization.

## Key Components

### 1. API Architecture
- Built with FastAPI for high-performance REST API
- OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)
- JWT-based authentication

### 2. LLM Integration
- Flexible provider architecture supporting multiple LLM providers:
  - **Ollama**: Local LLM deployment
  - **Groq**: Cloud-based LLM API
- Resilient design with circuit breaker pattern and retry mechanisms
- Factory pattern for client instantiation

#### LLM Client Structure
- `BaseLLMClient`: Abstract base class with common functionality
- Provider-specific implementations (`OllamaClient`, `GroqClient`)
- Sentiment analysis capabilities for processing employee responses

### 3. Interview Management
- Complete CRUD operations for interviews
- Status tracking (scheduled, in_progress, completed)
- Message handling for conversational flow
- Report generation for completed interviews

### 4. User Management
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Profile management

## Key Endpoints

### Interview Endpoints
- `GET /interviews/`: List interviews with optional filters
- `POST /interviews/`: Create new interviews
- `GET /interviews/{id}`: Retrieve specific interview
- `PUT /interviews/{id}`: Update interview status and details
- `DELETE /interviews/{id}`: Remove interviews (admin only)
- `POST /interviews/{id}/messages`: Send messages in conversation
- `GET /interviews/{id}/messages`: Retrieve conversation history
- `POST /interviews/{id}/reports`: Generate interview reports
- `GET /interviews/{id}/reports`: Retrieve generated reports

### User Endpoints
- `POST /users/`: Create new users
- `GET /users/me`: Get current user
- `PUT /users/me`: Update current user
- `GET /users/{id}`: Get user by ID (admin only)
- `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user by ID (admin only)

## Conversation Flow
1. Admin schedules exit interview for departing employee
2. Employee logs in and starts the interview
3. LLM asks questions and follows up based on responses
4. Responses are stored in the database
5. After completion, a summary report is generated
6. HR can review reports and analyze feedback

## Technical Features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Database session management
- Background task processing
- Structured logging
- Templated prompts for consistent LLM interactions
- Performance optimizations:
  - Database query optimization with indexes
  - LLM response caching with TTL
  - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience

## Development Status
All planned development tasks have been successfully completed. The ExitBot MVP is now ready for production deployment with the following recent achievements:

### Pydantic v2 Migration
- Updated all schemas to Pydantic v2 compatibility:
  - Replaced `validator` with `field_validator` and `root_validator` with `model_validator`
  - Updated validator parameter handling to use info.data
  - Changed `Config` classes with `model_config` dictionaries
  - Replaced `orm_mode=True` with `from_attributes=True`
  - Updated import paths for Pydantic settings

### Deployment Configuration
- Docker and Heroku deployment configuration completed
- Environment variable configuration set up
- Production-ready logging implemented
- Database initialization scripts finalized

### Testing and Documentation
- End-to-end testing verified in production environment
- API endpoints fully documented
- User guides created for both HR administrators and employees
- Security review completed
- Comprehensive deployment documentation created

The ExitBot MVP has been successfully developed, tested, and is now ready for production use.
