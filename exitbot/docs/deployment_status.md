## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose
2. Python 3.8 or higher (for local development)
3. Make (optional, for using Makefile commands)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Setup Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` file to configure:
   - Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` for production deployment
   - Update `SECRET_KEY` with a secure random string
   - Configure database credentials
   - Set admin user credentials
   - Configure LLM provider settings (Groq API key or Ollama URL)
   - Set `CORS_ORIGINS` with allowed origins as a JSON array

2. **Run Automated Deployment**:
   - For Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./deploy.sh production
   ```
   - For Windows:
   ```powershell
   cd scripts
   .\deploy.ps1 -Environment production
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check API: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
   - Check frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Check monitoring: `http://localhost:3001` (Grafana)

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Obtain Final Approvals**: Get sign-off from all stakeholders
2. **Schedule Production Deployment**: Coordinate with operations team
3. **Conduct Post-Deployment Verification**: Perform final verification in production
4. **Train End Users**: Provide training sessions for system users

## Deployment Readiness Assessment
