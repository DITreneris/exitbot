# Afternoon Progress Summary (April 17, 2025) - Update 6

## Goal Achieved

Investigate and resolve the widespread test failures (~36 initially) reported by `pytest -v`, primarily in the API and authentication modules.

## Progress & Fixes

*   **Initial State:** 36 failed tests, mostly 401 Unauthorized and 404 Not Found errors in API endpoints and authentication tests.
*   **Debugging Steps & Resolutions:**
    1.  **Fixed Password Hashing:** Corrected `get_password_hash` import in `exitbot/app/db/crud/user.py` from `exitbot.app.auth` to `exitbot.app.core.security`, resolving initial `401` errors on login.
    2.  **Fixed API Routing:**
        *   Removed redundant `prefix="/api/v1"` from `api_router` definition in `exitbot/app/api/api.py`.
        *   Changed `API_V1_PREFIX` in `exitbot/app/core/config.py` from `/api/v1` to `/api` to align with test path expectations. This resolved the `404 Not Found` errors.
    3.  **Removed Global Auth Override:** Deleted the `autouse=True` fixture `override_auth` from `exitbot/tests/conftest.py`. This fixture was incorrectly forcing all authenticated endpoints to use `test_employee`, causing numerous `403 Forbidden` and incorrect user assertion failures. Removing it allowed tests to use the provided tokens correctly.
    4.  **Fixed Performance Test (`test_standalone_interview_message_performance`):**
        *   Updated hardcoded API paths from `/api/v1/...` to `/api/...`.
        *   Used the correct `admin_token_user` for interview creation/update and `employee_token` for sending messages.
        *   Moved the test function into the `TestPerformance` class.
        *   Removed the incompatible global `mock_ollama` fixture from `conftest.py`.
        *   Corrected the `TestPerformance` class's `mock_llm_client` fixture to mock the `.chat()` method instead of `.generate_response()`.

## Current State

*   **80 tests passed**, 27 skipped, 4 warnings.
*   The core API functionality, authentication, and authorization appear to be working correctly within the test environment.

## Next Steps

The primary focus shifts to the **27 skipped tests**:

1.  **Prioritize `test_api_utils.py`:** Analyze the skipped tests in this file. They were previously skipped due to "References outdated direct_app..." or similar issues.
    *   Refactor these tests to align with the current application structure (`app` instance, `client` fixture, correct dependencies like `get_current_active_user`).
    *   Remove the `pytest.skip` markers.
    *   Run `pytest -v exitbot/tests/test_api_utils.py` to verify.
2.  **Address Other Skips:** Investigate skipped tests in `test_frontend_components.py`, `test_reports.py`, etc., as needed. These might require further implementation or context.
