# Exit Interview Bot - Afternoon Session 8 Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Addressed API errors (500 Internal Server Error)
   - Fixed database constraint issues
   - Modified error handling to retain user messages during failures
   - Improved user experience during API rate limiting (429) errors

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Developed a plan to switch from dynamic LLM responses to predefined questions
   - Created `afternoon_ses4.md` with detailed implementation strategy
   - Established `exitbot/app/core/interview_questions.py` with 20 predefined exit interview questions

## Issues Faced & Solutions

1. **Database Constraints**
   - Issue: NOT NULL constraint failures in database
   - Solution: Modified schema to allow nullable fields where appropriate
   - Action: Deleted existing SQLite database and restarted with new schema

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Issue: Groq API returning 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
   - Solution: 
     - Modified frontend to retain messages during errors
     - Planned implementation of predefined questions to reduce API calls
     - Improved error handling and user feedback

3. **User Experience**
   - Issue: Application crashes and stuck spinner during errors
   - Solution: Modified `employee_app.py` to maintain message visibility
   - Result: Better feedback and stability during error conditions

## Current Status

1. **Completed**
   - Error handling improvements
   - Predefined questions structure
   - Implementation planning
   - Basic architecture decisions

2. **In Progress**
   - Transition to predefined questions system
   - Frontend/backend modifications for new question flow

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Modifications**
   - Modify `create_interview` endpoint to use predefined questions
   - Update `send_message` endpoint to handle question progression
   - Implement question state tracking
   - Retain LLM usage for HR analysis and reporting

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Update `employee_app.py` to handle predefined question flow
   - Implement proper state management for question progression
   - Enhance error handling and user feedback

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create test cases for new question flow
   - Validate proper progression through questions
   - Test error scenarios and recovery
   - Verify HR reporting functionality

4. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation for new endpoints
   - Document predefined question structure
   - Create user guide for new interview flow

## Technical Debt & Considerations

1. **Performance**
   - Monitor application performance with new question flow
   - Optimize database queries for question retrieval
   - Consider caching strategies if needed

2. **Scalability**
   - Ensure question management system is maintainable
   - Plan for potential future question updates
   - Consider internationalization requirements

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement logging for question progression
   - Track success rates of interviews
   - Monitor LLM usage in HR analysis

## Timeline & Priorities

1. **Immediate (Next Session)**
   - Implement backend changes for predefined questions
   - Update frontend to handle new question flow
   - Basic testing of new implementation

2. **Short Term**
   - Complete testing suite
   - User acceptance testing
   - Documentation updates

3. **Medium Term**
   - Performance optimization
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - User feedback incorporation

## Conclusion

Today's session made significant progress in stabilizing the application and planning a more robust architecture. The transition to predefined questions will improve reliability while maintaining the valuable LLM-based analysis for HR purposes. The next session should focus on implementing the backend changes for the new question flow.
