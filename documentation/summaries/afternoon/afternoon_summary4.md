# Afternoon Session 4 Summary

## Goal

Test the concurrency handling of the `@cached_llm_response` decorator in `exitbot/app/llm/cache.py`. Ensure that concurrent calls with identical arguments trigger the underlying function only once, with subsequent calls hitting the cache.

## Progress Made

1.  **Initial Test Run:** Executed `pytest exitbot/test_cache_manually.py -k test_concurrent_cache_access` based on prior refactoring attempts.
2.  **Issue Found (ImportError):** The test failed because it tried to import and instantiate a non-existent `LLMCache` class.
3.  **Refactoring 1:** Corrected the test (`test_concurrent_cache_access`) to use the global `_cache` and patch the underlying `mock_llm_call` function.
4.  **Issue Found (Patching Target):** Test failed (`AssertionError: Expected call count 1, got 0`). Patching `mock_llm_call` did not affect the already-decorated `cached_mock_llm_call` which held a reference to the original function.
5.  **Refactoring 2:** Attempted patching `cached_mock_llm_call.__wrapped__`.
6.  **Issue Found (Still Patching Target):** Test still failed (`AssertionError: Expected call count 1, got 0`), indicating the patch was still ineffective.
7.  **Refactoring 3 (Counter Method):** Removed patching. Added a global counter to the original `mock_llm_call` and asserted the counter value in the test.
8.  **Issue Found (Race Condition):** Test failed (`AssertionError: Expected call count 1, got 5`). This revealed a race condition in the `cached_llm_response` decorator itself, where multiple threads executed the underlying function before the cache was populated.
9.  **Fix Implemented:** Modified `exitbot/app/llm/cache.py`:
    *   Imported `threading`.
    *   Added a `_key_locks` dictionary (`Dict[str, threading.Lock]`) to hold locks per cache key.
    *   Added `_locks_dict_lock` (`threading.Lock`) to protect `_key_locks`.
    *   Implemented a lock acquisition and double-check pattern within the decorator's wrapper function to ensure only one thread computes the result for a given key during concurrent access.
10. **Final Test Run:** Executed `pytest exitbot/test_cache_manually.py -k test_concurrent_cache_access`.

## Result

*   The final test run **PASSED**. The concurrency handling in `@cached_llm_response` is now validated.

## Next Steps

*   Review the implemented locking mechanism for potential improvements (e.g., lock removal during pruning).
*   Consider adding more specific tests for cache expiry and pruning under concurrent load (optional).
*   Proceed with next development task.
