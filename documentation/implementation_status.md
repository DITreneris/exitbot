# Predefined Questions Implementation Status

This document tracks the current implementation status of the predefined questions system for the Exit Interview Bot.

## Implementation Overview

The predefined questions system replaces the LLM-based conversation flow with a structured sequence of fixed questions to improve reliability and reduce API costs.

## Components Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backend Core (`interview_questions.py`) | ‚úÖ Complete | Contains predefined questions list and helper functions |
| API Endpoints (`interview.py`) | ‚úÖ Complete | Updated to handle question flow and progression |
| Message Schema | ‚úÖ Complete | Includes question count, progression, and completion status |
| Frontend Integration | ‚úÖ Complete | Enhanced UI with progress indicators and improved error handling |
| Test Suite | ‚úÖ Enhanced | Core tests complete, edge case tests added |
| Documentation | ‚úÖ Complete | Technical docs, deployment guide, and user guide created |
| Validation Script | ‚úÖ Complete | Created script to validate deployment readiness |

## Recent Updates

- Enhanced client-side API functions to better handle predefined questions flow
- Added edge case tests to increase test coverage
- Created validation script for deployment readiness
- Updated frontend integration for improved error handling and progress tracking

## Known Issues

- State management during browser refresh in employee_app.py needs thorough testing
- Potential race conditions during concurrent message submission
- Error handling for database connection failures could be improved

## Next Steps

1. ‚è±Ô∏è **Deploy to staging environment for validation** - Highest priority
   - Use the validation script to verify functionality
   - Monitor logs for any unexpected errors
   - Get feedback from test users

2. üîç **Additional testing** 
   - Conduct load testing to ensure system stability under high usage
   - Test network failures and recovery scenarios
   - Validate cross-browser compatibility for the frontend

3. üìä **Analytics and monitoring**
   - Implement metrics for interview completion rates
   - Add tracking for time spent on each question
   - Monitor error rates and API performance

4. üìñ **Training and roll-out**
   - Schedule training sessions for HR team
   - Create user guides for employees
   - Plan gradual rollout strategy

## Dependencies

- No external LLM API required for core functionality
- Database schema remains unchanged
- No new third-party libraries added

## Metrics & Success Criteria

- Response time reduction: 60-80% expected improvement over LLM flow
- Cost reduction: Minimal external API usage
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime target for interview sessions
- Completion rate: Target 95%+ interviews completed successfully

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Employees find fixed questions limiting | Medium | Medium | Create comprehensive question set with all critical topics |
| Loss of insights from LLM analysis | Medium | Low | Develop separate analysis tool for HR to run on completed interviews |
| Increased database load from more direct queries | Low | Low | Implement caching and optimize query patterns |
| Frontend compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Thorough cross-browser testing before deployment |

## Conclusion

The predefined questions implementation is largely complete and ready for validation in a staging environment. After successful validation, we can proceed with deployment to production.
