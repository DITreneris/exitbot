# Phased Rollout Strategy

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for deploying the predefined questions system to production, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption.

## Phase 1: Internal Testing (1 week)

**Goal:** Validate functionality and gather initial feedback in a controlled environment.

### Actions

1. **Deploy to staging environment**
   - Apply database migrations
   - Deploy updated codebase with predefined questions
   - Set feature flag `ENABLE_PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS=true`
   - Set feature flag `ALLOW_LLM_FALLBACK=true`

2. **Perform validation testing**
   - Run `validate_staging_deployment.py` to verify all endpoints
   - Validate performance metrics (response times < 500ms)
   - Test all edge cases documented in test suite

3. **Internal HR team simulation**
   - Select 3-5 HR team members for testing
   - Create simulated exit interviews (5-10 per HR member)
   - Collect structured feedback on:
     - User interface clarity
     - Question flow experience
     - Reporting functionality
     - Export data quality

4. **Bug fixing and adjustments**
   - Address any issues discovered during testing
   - Make UI improvements based on HR feedback
   - Update documentation as needed

### Success Criteria

- All validation tests pass successfully
- Performance metrics meet target thresholds
- No critical bugs identified
- HR team satisfaction rating of 4+ out of 5

### Rollback Plan

1. Revert to previous codebase version
2. Run database rollback script if needed
3. Set feature flag `ENABLE_PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS=false`

## Phase 2: Limited Production (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Validate the system with real users while maintaining the existing system as primary.

### Actions

1. **Controlled deployment to production**
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Configure feature flags:
     - `ENABLE_PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS=true`
     - `ALLOW_LLM_FALLBACK=true`
     - `PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS_RATIO=0.25` (25% of new interviews)

2. **Traffic steering configuration**
   - Employee IDs ending in 0-2 use predefined questions (25%)
   - All other IDs continue using LLM-based interviews (75%)
   - HR admins can override for specific interviews if needed

3. **Comparative metrics collection**
   - Track and compare between systems:
     - Interview completion rates
     - Average time per question
     - Response length and quality
     - HR satisfaction with results
     - System reliability metrics

4. **Daily monitoring reviews**
   - Review error logs and performance metrics daily
   - Meet with HR team twice weekly for feedback
   - Document any issues or improvement opportunities

### Success Criteria

- Predefined system achieves equal or better completion rates 
- Response time remains under 500ms for 95% of requests
- No increase in support tickets related to interview system
- HR feedback remains positive (4+ out of 5)

### Rollback Plan

1. Set feature flag `PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS_RATIO=0.0`
2. Keep both systems available in case of issues
3. If critical issues arise, fully disable via `ENABLE_PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS=false`

## Phase 3: Expanded Rollout (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Make predefined questions the primary system while ensuring full coverage across departments.

### Actions

1. **Increase predefined questions coverage**
   - Update feature flag `PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS_RATIO=0.75`
   - Employee IDs ending in 0-7 use predefined questions (75%)
   - IDs ending in 8-9 continue with LLM system (25%)

2. **Department-specific focus**
   - Prioritize high-volume departments first:
     - Sales and Marketing
     - Customer Support
     - Engineering
     - Operations
   - Collect department-specific feedback

3. **HR team training completion**
   - Conduct training sessions for all HR team members
   - Provide reference materials and guides
   - Establish support contacts for questions

4. **Refinement and optimization**
   - Fine-tune system based on Phase 2 feedback
   - Optimize database queries for improved performance
   - Enhance reporting features based on HR requests

### Success Criteria

- Successful processing of 75% of all interviews
- Consistent performance across all departments
- All HR team members trained and comfortable with the system
- Reporting capabilities meet all HR requirements

### Rollback Plan

1. If issues affect specific departments, adjust routing to exclude those departments
2. Ability to revert to LLM system for specific interviews as needed
3. Option to decrease ratio (`PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS_RATIO=0.25`) if widespread issues

## Phase 4: Full Deployment (1 week)

**Goal:** Complete the transition to the predefined questions system as the standard approach.

### Actions

1. **Complete production deployment**
   - Update feature flag `PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS_RATIO=1.0`
   - All new exit interviews use predefined questions
   - Keep LLM system available as fallback only

2. **System monitoring and optimization**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring dashboard
   - Configure alerts for any performance degradation
   - Optimize database indexes for common query patterns

3. **Documentation finalization**
   - Update all system documentation
   - Create knowledge base articles for common questions
   - Record training videos for new HR staff

4. **Feedback collection system**
   - Implement system for ongoing feedback collection
   - Create monthly reporting on system effectiveness
   - Establish process for suggesting question improvements

### Success Criteria

- 100% of new interviews using predefined questions
- System performance remains within target thresholds
- Support tickets related to interview system remain low
- HR team consistently rates system 4+ out of 5

### Fallback Options

- LLM system remains available via admin override
- Critical issues can be addressed by setting `ENABLE_PREDEFINED_QUESTIONS=false`
- Individual questions can be modified without full system rollback

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (Ongoing)

After full deployment, we will maintain ongoing monitoring to ensure continued success:

1. **Weekly performance reviews**
   - Response time trends
   - Interview completion rates
   - Database performance metrics
   - Error rates and patterns

2. **Monthly effectiveness evaluation**
   - Quality of collected data
   - HR satisfaction surveys
   - Question effectiveness analysis
   - Comparison with historical LLM data

3. **Quarterly system tuning**
   - Review and update question set if needed
   - Optimize database structures
   - Implement feature enhancements
   - Schedule any required maintenance

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Performance monitoring, auto-scaling resources |
| Data inconsistency | Low | High | Data validation checks, backup procedures |
| HR resistance to change | Medium | Medium | Thorough training, highlight benefits, collect feedback |
| Employee confusion | Medium | Low | Clear instructions, improved UI, help resources |
| System availability issues | Low | High | Fallback to LLM system, redundancy in deployment |

## Communication Plan

Throughout the rollout, we will maintain clear communication with all stakeholders:

1. **HR Leadership**
   - Weekly status reports
   - Immediate notification of any issues
   - Performance metrics dashboard

2. **HR Staff**
   - Training sessions before each phase
   - Documentation and support resources
   - Feedback collection forms

3. **IT Support**
   - System architecture documentation
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Escalation procedures

4. **Employees**
   - Updated interview instructions
   - Notification of changes to process
   - Feedback option after interview completion

## Success Measurement

We will consider the rollout successful when:

1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Response time under 500ms for 95% of requests
   - System availability exceeds 99.9%
   - Zero critical bugs in production

2. **User Experience**
   - HR satisfaction rating of 4+ out of 5
   - Interview completion rate equal or better than LLM system
   - Positive qualitative feedback from HR staff

3. **Business Outcomes**
   - Reduction in operational costs (API usage)
   - Improved data quality and comparability
   - Enhanced reporting capabilities

## Conclusion

This phased rollout approach allows us to carefully transition to the predefined questions system with minimal disruption to ongoing exit interviews. By gradually increasing the percentage of interviews using the new system, we can validate its effectiveness, address any issues, and ensure HR staff are fully trained before completing the transition.

The focus on metrics, feedback, and clear success criteria at each phase ensures we can make informed decisions about proceeding to the next phase or addressing any concerns that arise.
