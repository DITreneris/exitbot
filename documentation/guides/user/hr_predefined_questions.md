# HR Guide: Working with the Predefined Questions System

## Introduction

The Exit Interview Bot has been updated to use a structured predefined questions approach. This guide explains how this change affects HR staff, how to interpret the results, and how to get the most value from the system.

## What Has Changed?

### Previous System
- Conversations were dynamically generated by an AI
- Questions varied between interviews
- Follow-up questions were generated based on responses
- Each interview could take a different path

### New System
- Fixed set of standard questions asked in sequence
- Consistent experience for all employees
- Structured data collection for better analytics
- Progress indicator shows completion status
- Faster response times and improved reliability

## Question Categories

The predefined questions are organized into categories to help with analysis:

| Category | Focus Area | Example Question |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Reasons | Primary reasons for leaving | "What primarily motivated your decision to leave our organization?" |
| Culture | Company culture and values | "Did the company culture align with your values and work style?" |
| Management | Relationship with management | "How would you assess your relationship with your direct manager?" |
| Development | Professional growth | "Were there sufficient opportunities for career advancement?" |
| Experience | Day-to-day work experience | "What aspects of your role did you find most fulfilling?" |
| Recognition | Rewards and recognition | "How well did the organization recognize your contributions?" |
| Improvement | Areas for company improvement | "What improvements would you suggest regarding company processes?" |
| Future | Future relationship | "Would you consider returning to the organization in the future?" |

## Viewing Interview Results

When reviewing completed interviews in the HR dashboard:

1. Navigate to "Interviews" → "Completed"
2. Select an interview to view details
3. You'll see all questions and responses displayed in sequence
4. Responses are grouped by category for easier analysis

## Analyzing Results

### Individual Interviews

For individual interviews, look for:

- Specific issues mentioned in responses
- Themes across multiple questions
- Sentiment indicators (positive/negative tone)
- Actionable feedback for improvements

### Aggregate Analysis

The reporting section now includes:

- Response comparison by question
- Category-based sentiment analysis
- Trend analysis over time
- Department-specific insights

### Exporting Data

You can export the structured data for further analysis:

1. Go to "Reports" → "Data Export"
2. Select date range and departments
3. Choose export format (CSV, Excel, JSON)
4. Download the file for analysis in external tools

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I customize the questions?
A: Question modifications require administrator access. Contact your system administrator if you need questions added or modified.

### Q: What happened to the old interview data?
A: All previous interview data remains accessible. The system distinguishes between LLM-based and predefined question interviews in reports.

### Q: How can I provide feedback on the questions?
A: Use the "Feedback" option in the HR dashboard or contact the HR Technology team.

### Q: Can employees skip questions?
A: Yes, employees can provide blank responses to skip questions they prefer not to answer.

### Q: How long should an interview take?
A: With 20 standard questions, most employees complete the interview in 15-20 minutes.

## Best Practices

1. **Introduce the new format** to departing employees so they know what to expect

2. **Review all categories** when analyzing results, not just the "Reasons" for leaving

3. **Look for patterns** across multiple interviews rather than focusing on individual responses

4. **Track trends over time** to identify systemic issues that may need addressing

5. **Compare responses by department** to identify department-specific concerns

6. **Combine quantitative data** from the predefined questions with qualitative insights from in-person exit interviews

## Reporting Features
