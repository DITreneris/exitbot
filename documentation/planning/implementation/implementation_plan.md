# Exit Interview Bot - Detailed Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for completing the Exit Interview Bot application, with a focus on the most critical issues identified in the evaluation report. The plan is structured into four main phases:

1. **Immediate Stabilization** (1-2 weeks)
2. **Security Enhancements** (2-3 weeks)
3. **Performance Optimization** (2-3 weeks)
4. **Testing & Monitoring** (Ongoing)

Each phase contains specific goals, tasks, timelines, and responsible roles to ensure clear accountability and progress tracking.

## 2. Predefined Questions Transition (High Priority)

### 2.1 Background

The application is currently transitioning from a fully dynamic LLM-based conversation to a structured, predefined question approach. This change is critical for stability and will significantly reduce dependency on the Groq API, which has experienced rate limiting issues.

### 2.2 Current Status

1. **Completed**:
   - Predefined questions structure established in `exitbot/app/core/interview_questions.py`
   - Initial implementation of `create_interview` endpoint to use first predefined question
   - Basic structure for `send_message` endpoint to handle question progression

2. **In Progress**:
   - Frontend integration to handle question progression
   - Testing of the end-to-end flow
   - Error handling during question transitions

### 2.3 Implementation Tasks

#### Backend Implementation

1. **Modify `create_interview` Endpoint** (1 day)
   - [ ] Ensure first predefined question is returned
   - [ ] Store initial question as first response
   - [ ] Add proper error handling for question retrieval

2. **Update `send_message` Endpoint** (2 days)
   - [ ] Implement question progression logic based on response count
   - [ ] Handle end-of-interview condition
   - [ ] Add interview completion marker
   - [ ] Enhance error handling
   - [ ] Consider adding explicit question state to response schema

```python
# Example code for send_message endpoint
@router.post("/{interview_id}/messages", response_model=MessageSchema)
async def send_message(
    interview_id: int,
    message: MessageCreate,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Verify interview exists
    interview = crud.get_interview(db, interview_id)
    if not interview:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Interview not found")
    
    # Get previous responses to determine next question
    previous_responses = crud.get_responses_by_interview(db, interview_id)
    next_question_order = len(previous_responses) + 1
    
    # Get next question
    next_question = get_question_by_order(next_question_order)
    
    # Store user's response
    crud.create_response(
        db=db,
        interview_id=interview_id,
        employee_message=message.content,
        bot_response=next_question["text"] if next_question else "Thank you for completing the interview.",
        question_id=next_question["id"] if next_question else None
    )
    
    # If no more questions, mark interview as complete
    if not next_question:
        crud.update_interview(
            db=db,
            interview_id=interview_id,
            update_dict={"status": "COMPLETED", "completed_at": datetime.now()}
        )
        
    # Return response
    return {
        "content": next_question["text"] if next_question else "Thank you for completing the exit interview. Your feedback is valuable to us.",
        "is_complete": next_question is None
    }
```

#### Frontend Updates

1. **Update `employee_app.py`** (2 days)
   - [ ] Add progress indicator (e.g., "Question 5 of 20")
   - [ ] Improve completion state detection
   - [ ] Enhance error handling for API failures
   - [ ] Add visual feedback for question transitions

```python
# Example code for employee_app.py update
def _display_interview_interface():
    # Display messages
    if st.session_state.messages:
        for message in st.session_state.messages:
            # Display message UI...
    
    # Check for interview completion
    if st.session_state.interview_complete:
        st.success("Thank you for completing your exit interview!")
        st.balloons()
    else:
        # Get question count if available
        responses = len([m for m in st.session_state.messages if m["role"] == "user"])
        total_questions = 20  # Could be fetched from API
        
        # Show progress indicator
        if responses > 0:
            st.progress(min(1.0, responses / total_questions))
            st.caption(f"Question {responses} of {total_questions}")
        
        # Message input
        user_input = st.text_area("Your response:", key="user_input")
        
        if st.button("Send"):
            if user_input:
                # Add user message to state
                st.session_state.messages.append({
                    "role": "user", 
                    "content": user_input
                })
                
                # Send to API
                response, error = send_interview_message(
                    st.session_state.token,
                    st.session_state.interview_id,
                    user_input
                )
                
                if error:
                    display_api_error(error)
                elif response:
                    # Add bot response
                    st.session_state.messages.append({
                        "role": "assistant",
                        "content": response.get("content", "")
                    })
                    
                    # Check if interview is complete
                    if response.get("is_complete", False):
                        st.session_state.interview_complete = True
                
                # Clear input
