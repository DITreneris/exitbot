ExitBot MVP: HR Exit Interview Bot with Ollama
Objective
ExitBot is a Python-based conversational bot that conducts structured exit interviews with departing employees, collects feedback, and generates reports for HR. By using Ollama for local LLM inference, ExitBot ensures privacy, reduces latency, and simplifies NLP setup while remaining easy to deploy and adaptable to any organization.
Key Features (MVP Scope)
Conversational Interface: Uses an Ollama-hosted LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1 or Mistral) to engage employees in natural, empathetic conversations with predefined questions and dynamic follow-ups.

Structured Workflow: Guides employees through a standard exit interview question set (reasons for leaving, satisfaction, feedback, suggestions) with customizable prompts.

Data Collection and Reporting: Stores responses securely in a local database and generates summary reports (e.g., sentiment trends, key themes).

Ease of Use: Simple web or chat interface for employees; minimal setup for HR admins.

Adaptability: Configurable for different organizations, with support for custom questions and future multi-language capabilities.

Tech Stack
The revised tech stack incorporates Ollama for NLP, maintaining performance and ease of deployment.
Backend:
Python 3.11: Core language for bot logic and API.

FastAPI: High-performance framework for REST APIs to handle bot interactions and HR dashboards.

SQLAlchemy: ORM for database interactions, supporting multiple databases.

Pydantic: For data validation and serialization of responses.

Natural Language Processing:
Ollama: Runs a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1 8B or Mistral 7B) for conversational logic, intent recognition, and response generation.
Benefits: No external API calls, full control over data, customizable prompts.

Example models: Llama 3.1 (general-purpose) or Mistral (lightweight, fast).

LangChain (optional): To structure LLM prompts and manage conversation context, ensuring consistent question flow.

Database:
PostgreSQL: Reliable relational database for storing responses and configurations.

SQLite (optional): For small-scale deployments or testing.

Frontend:
Streamlit: Python-based web interface for employee interactions and HR report dashboards.

Slack/Teams Integration (optional): Deploy ExitBot as a chat app for organizations using these platforms.

Deployment:
Docker: Containerize the app (FastAPI, Ollama, Streamlit) for consistent deployment.

Heroku/AWS Elastic Beanstalk: For cloud deployment in the MVP phase.

Local Server: Ollama’s local hosting makes it ideal for on-premises deployment.

Security:
OAuth2/JWT: Secure authentication for HR admins and employees.

HTTPS: Encrypted communication.

Data Anonymization: Configurable to comply with GDPR/CCPA.

Performance Considerations
Scalability:
FastAPI handles concurrent requests efficiently.

Ollama’s local inference can be optimized by selecting lightweight models (e.g., Mistral 7B) or using GPU acceleration for larger organizations.

Database indexing for fast response retrieval.

Reliability:
Error handling for LLM failures or invalid inputs.

Logging (via logging module) for debugging.

Database backups for data recovery.

Optimization:
Cache LLM prompts and question templates in memory (e.g., using Redis or in-memory storage).

Use quantized models in Ollama (e.g., 4-bit quantization) to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core MVP Development (4-5 Weeks)
Bot Logic with Ollama:
Set up Ollama with a chosen LLM (e.g., ollama run llama3.1:8b).

Define a prompt template for exit interviews, e.g.:
plaintext

You are ExitBot, an HR assistant conducting an exit interview. Ask one question at a time from this list: 
1. Why are you leaving the organization? 
2. How satisfied were you with your role? 
3. Any feedback for your team or manager? 
4. What can we improve? 
Follow up on responses to gather details. Be empathetic and neutral. Current question: {current_question}
Employee response: {user_input}

Use LangChain (optional) to manage conversation state and question flow.

Implement sentiment analysis using simple keyword matching or a secondary LLM call.

API and Database:
Build FastAPI endpoints:
/interview: Accepts employee input and returns ExitBot’s response.

/report: Retrieves and summarizes responses for HR.

Set up PostgreSQL with tables for employees, responses, and question configurations.

Use SQLAlchemy for database operations.

Frontend:
Create a Streamlit app with:
A chat interface for employees to interact with ExitBot.

An HR dashboard to view responses and export reports.

Add a form for HR to upload custom questions.

Testing:
Unit tests for API endpoints (pytest).

Simulate exit interviews with mock data to validate LLM responses.

Test Ollama’s performance with different models and prompt sizes.

Phase 2: Deployment and Integration (2 Weeks)
Containerization:
Create Docker images for FastAPI, Ollama, and Streamlit.

Use Docker Compose for local testing.

Deployment:
Deploy locally for organizations with on-premises servers (ideal for privacy).

Alternatively, deploy to Heroku/AWS for cloud-based setups.

Configure environment variables (e.g., database URL, Ollama host).

Integration:
Add Slack/Teams webhooks for chat-based interviews.

Provide API documentation for HR system integration (e.g., Workday).

Phase 3: Post-MVP Enhancements (Future)
Add voice support (speech-to-text with libraries like SpeechRecognition).

Implement advanced analytics (e.g., clustering feedback by department).

Support multi-language interviews using LLM translation capabilities.

Optimize Ollama with larger models or fine-tuning for HR-specific language.

Sample Code Snippet
Below is an example of the FastAPI backend integrating with Ollama for ExitBot.
python

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
import ollama
from database import SessionLocal, Response  # Assume SQLAlchemy models

app = FastAPI()

# Pydantic model for request
class InterviewRequest(BaseModel):
    employee_id: str
    message: str

# Database dependency
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

# Exit interview questions
QUESTIONS = [
    "Why are you leaving the organization?",
    "How satisfied were you with your role?",
    "Any feedback for your team or manager?",
    "What can we improve?"
]

@app.post("/interview")
async def conduct_interview(request: InterviewRequest, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    try:
        # Get current question (simplified; use state management for production)
        current_question = QUESTIONS[0]  # Replace with logic to track question flow
        
        # Construct prompt for Ollama
        prompt = f"""

        """
        
        # Call Ollama
        response = ollama.generate(model="llama3.1:8b", prompt=prompt)
        bot_response = response["response"]
        
        # Save to database
        db_response = Response(
            employee_id=request.employee_id,
            message=request.message,
            bot_response=bot_response
        )
        db.add(db_response)
        db.commit()
        
        return {"response": bot_response}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

@app.get("/report/{employee_id}")
async def get_report(employee_id: str, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    responses = db.query(Response).filter(Response.employee_id == employee_id).all()
    return {"employee_id": employee_id, "responses": [r.to_dict() for r in responses]}

Database Model (example database.py):
python

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class Response(Base):
    __tablename__ = "responses"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    employee_id = Column(String, index=True)
    message = Column(String)
    bot_response = Column(String)

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            "id": self.id,
            "employee_id": self.employee_id,
            "message": self.message,
            "bot_response": self.bot_response
        }

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///exitbot.db")  # Or PostgreSQL URL
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

Ollama Setup
Install Ollama (already done, per your setup):
Ensure Ollama is running (ollama serve).

Pull a model: ollama pull llama3.1:8b or ollama pull mistral:7b.

Test Ollama:
bash

ollama run llama3.1:8b "Hello, I'm ExitBot. Why are you leaving the organization?"

Verify that the model responds appropriately.

Optimize for Performance:
Use a quantized model (e.g., llama3.1:8b-q4_0) for faster inference.

If you have a GPU, configure Ollama to use it for acceleration.

Ease of Adoption
