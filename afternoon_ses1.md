# Afternoon Session 1 - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed LLM Client Structure**
   - Reviewed the base client architecture in `client_base.py`
   - Examined provider-specific implementations:
     - `ollama_client.py` for local LLM deployment
     - `groq_client.py` for cloud API integration
   - Identified resilience features (circuit breaker pattern, retry logic)

2. **Explored LLM Factory Implementation**
   - Analyzed the factory pattern in `factory.py`
   - Understood provider selection and fallback mechanisms
   - Reviewed singleton implementation for application-wide usage

3. **Investigated Interview Endpoints**
   - Examined the message exchange flow in `interviews.py`
   - Reviewed how LLM responses are managed and stored
   - Understood the report generation process

4. **Studied Prompt Templates**
   - Reviewed the structured prompt system in `prompts.py`
   - Analyzed different prompt types:
     - Interview conversation prompts
     - Follow-up question determination
     - Summary generation

5. **Created Development Summary**
   - Compiled findings into a comprehensive markdown document
   - Documented key components, endpoints, and technical features
   - Provided overview of the application architecture

## Insights

- The application uses a robust design pattern for LLM integration that allows:
  - Easy switching between providers
  - Graceful handling of service failures
  - Consistent prompt formatting

- The conversation flow is well-structured:
  - Messages are properly contextualized for the LLM
  - Response history is maintained for coherent exchanges
  - Sentiment analysis provides additional data points

- The system implements proper separation of concerns:
  - Database operations separated from API endpoints
  - LLM client implementation isolated from business logic
  - Prompt templates maintained separately for easy updating

## Next Steps

1. Explore testing strategy for LLM interactions
2. Review database schema and ORM implementation
3. Investigate potential areas for performance optimization
4. Consider additional LLM providers that could be integrated
5. Evaluate the report generation quality and potential improvements
