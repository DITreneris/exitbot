# EU Funding Proposal - ExitBot: AI-Powered Privacy-First Exit Interview Platform

## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Description of Innovativeness of the Prototype to be Developed

**The Innovation: ExitBot - Privacy-First AI-Powered Exit Interview Platform**

ExitBot represents a groundbreaking approach to HR exit interviews, combining local AI processing with privacy-first architecture to address critical organizational knowledge retention challenges. Our innovative solution leverages local Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama to conduct empathetic, intelligent exit interviews while ensuring complete data sovereignty.

**Problem Scope & Market Need:**
- **€47.2 billion** annual cost of employee turnover in the EU (European Business Network, 2023)
- **73%** of organizations report inadequate exit interview processes (SHRM, 2023)
- **89%** of departing employees withhold critical feedback due to privacy concerns (Deloitte, 2023)
- **Only 12%** of companies effectively analyze exit interview data for retention strategies

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Local AI Processing:** Unlike cloud-based solutions, ExitBot runs entirely on-premises using Ollama's local LLM infrastructure, ensuring GDPR compliance and eliminating data sovereignty concerns.

2. **Empathetic Conversational AI:** Advanced prompt engineering creates natural, empathetic conversations that encourage honest feedback through structured yet flexible dialogue.

3. **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:** Proprietary sentiment analysis algorithms provide immediate insights into employee emotions and satisfaction levels.

4. **Privacy-by-Design Architecture:** Zero external API dependencies, local data storage, and configurable anonymization features ensure maximum privacy protection.

5. **Adaptive Question Framework:** Dynamic question sequencing based on employee responses, ensuring comprehensive feedback collection while maintaining conversation flow.

**Differentiating Features:**
- **100% Local Deployment:** No cloud dependencies, ensuring complete data control
- **Multi-Language Support:** EU language compliance with local processing capabilities
- **Real-time Analytics:** Immediate trend analysis and reporting without external data transmission
- **Integration-Ready:** API-first design for seamless HRIS integration
- **Open Architecture:** Extensible platform supporting custom workflows and third-party integrations
