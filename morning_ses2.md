# Morning Session Plan & Progress (Frontend Analysis) - April 19, 2025

## Goal

Analyze the frontend applications (`hr_app.py`, `employee_app.py`), identify key issues and blockers, and prepare for development work on the frontend.

## Analysis Summary

*   **Framework:** Streamlit
*   **Structure:** Two apps: `exitbot/frontend/hr_app.py` (HR Dashboard) and `exitbot/frontend/employee_app.py` (Employee Interview Chat).
*   **Backend:** Both interact with the FastAPI backend (URL configurable via `API_URL` env var) via `requests`.
*   **HR App:**
    *   Features: Login, dashboard (metrics, charts), interview list/details (with summary, responses, sentiment), reports (stats, department analysis, data export), placeholder settings tab.
    *   Tech: Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, custom HTML/CSS.
    *   API calls refactored into `frontend/api_client.py`, cached using `@st.cache_data`.
*   **Employee App:**
    *   Features: Employee identification form (email/name/dept/date), chat interface for interview, displays messages, handles interview completion.
    *   Tech: Streamlit, custom HTML/CSS.
    *   Uses `/api/auth/employee-access` to get token/ID and `POST /api/interviews/` to create session.
*   **State Management:** Uses `st.session_state` heavily.

## Key Issues & Blockers Identified (Initial)

1.  ~~**Critical Bug:** `employee_app.py` uses a hardcoded `employee_id=1`~~ **(Resolved)**
2.  ~~**Security Concern:** Employee identification in `employee_app.py` relies on user-provided info without verification.~~ **(Addressed via Option 2)**
3.  ~~**Configuration:** The backend API URL is hardcoded.~~ **(Resolved)**
4.  ~~**Maintainability:** `hr_app.py` is monolithic.~~ **(Partially Addressed via Refactoring)**
5.  ~~**Performance:** The HR app fetches data frequently without caching.~~ **(Resolved)**
6.  ~~**Incomplete Features:** The Settings tab in `hr_app.py` is largely a placeholder.~~ **(Partially Implemented: Question Management)**
7.  ~~**Authentication:** Token handling relies solely on `st.session_state`, meaning sessions are lost on browser close/refresh.~~ **(Addressed via Cookie Persistence)**
8.  ~~**Error Handling:** Basic error handling exists, but raw API error text might still be shown.~~ **(Refined: Centralized display, clearer messages)**
9.  ~~**Testing:** No frontend tests were found.~~ **(Initiated)**

## Session Progress & Outcomes

1.  ✅ **Fix Blocker:** Implemented `/api/auth/employee-access` endpoint in backend (`auth.py`) using `get_or_create_employee` CRUD function. Updated `employee_app.py` to call this endpoint, store `employee_id`, and use `POST /api/interviews/` for creation.
    *   **Outcome:** Interviews are now correctly associated with dynamic employee IDs.
2.  ✅ **Configuration:** Updated both `hr_app.py` and `employee_app.py` to read `API_URL` from environment variables. Added `API_URL` to `exitbot/.env.example`.
    *   **Outcome:** Backend URL is now configurable.
3.  ✅ **Security:** Implemented verification in `get_or_create_employee` (Option 2). If an existing user is found via email, the provided `full_name` and `department` must match the DB record.
    *   **Outcome:** Increased protection against simple impersonation or data mismatch during employee access.
4.  ✅ **Caching (HR App):** Added `@st.cache_data` decorators with appropriate TTLs to `get_all_interviews`, `get_interview_details`, `get_interview_summary`, `get_summary_stats`, and `get_department_breakdown` in `api_client.py`.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved potential performance and reduced backend load for the HR dashboard.
5.  ✅ **Refactoring (HR App):** Extracted API call functions from `hr_app.py` into `exitbot/frontend/api_client.py`. Updated `hr_app.py` to use the imported functions.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved code organization and separation of concerns in `hr_app.py`.
6.  ✅ **Testing (Initiation):** Created `exitbot/frontend/test_api_client.py`. Added `pytest` structure with mocking (`requests-mock`). Implemented initial tests covering `login`, `get_all_interviews`, `get_interview_details`, and `get_employee_access_details`.
    *   **Outcome:** Established a foundation for frontend API client testing; basic coverage achieved.
7.  ✅ **Session Persistence (HR App):** Integrated `streamlit-cookies-manager` into `hr_app.py` to store the authentication token in a browser cookie, persisting login sessions across refreshes and browser closures. Added `streamlit-cookies-manager` to `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved user experience for HR users by maintaining login state. (Addresses Issue #7)
8.  ✅ **Feature Implementation (Settings Tab):** Added Question Management functionality to the `hr_app.py` Settings tab. Implemented UI for viewing, adding, activating/deactivating, and deleting interview questions. Added corresponding CRUD functions (`get_questions`, `create_question`, `update_question`, `delete_question`) to `api_client.py`.
    *   **Outcome:** HR users can now manage interview questions directly through the dashboard. (Partially addresses Issue #6)
9.  ✅ **Error Handling Refinement:** Refactored all functions in `api_client.py` to return `(result, error_details)` tuples instead of directly using `st.error`/`st.warning`. Added helper functions (`_parse_error`, `_handle_request_exception`) for standardized error parsing, user-friendly message generation, and background logging. Updated `hr_app.py` to use the refactored client, check for errors, and display them via a new `display_api_error` helper function.
    *   **Outcome:** More robust and user-friendly error display in the frontend, with technical details logged for debugging. (Addresses Issue #8)

## Next Steps / Remaining Issues

*   Expand test coverage in `test_api_client.py` (including new functions and error handling).
*   Address remaining identified issues (Settings tab refinement - e.g., System Preferences if needed).
*   Consider further refactoring if needed.
*   Potentially implement UI/E2E tests for Streamlit apps.
